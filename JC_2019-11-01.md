**Abstract**: Training deep neural networks from scratch on natural language processing (NLP) tasks requires significant amount of manually labeled text corpus and substantial time to converge, which usually cannot be satisfied by the customers. In this paper, we aim to develop an effective transfer learning algorithm by fine-tuning a pre-trained language model. The goal is to provide expressive and convenient-to-use feature extractors for downstream NLP tasks, and achieve improvement in terms of accuracy, data efficiency, and generalization to new domains. Therefore, we propose an attention-based fine-tuning algorithm that automatically selects relevant contextualized features from the pre-trained language model and uses those features on downstream text classification tasks. We test our methods on six widely-used benchmarking datasets, and achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all of them. Moreover, we then introduce an alternative multi-task learning approach, which is an end-to-end algorithm given the pre-trained model. By doing multi-task learning, one can largely reduce the total training time by trading off some classification accuracy.

**Abstract**: Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.
