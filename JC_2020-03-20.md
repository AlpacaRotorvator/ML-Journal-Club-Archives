**Abstract**:  Time series forecasting with limited data is a challenging yet critical task. While transformers have achieved outstanding performances in time series forecasting, they often require many training samples due to the large number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we propose a training technique for transformers that prepares the training windows through random sampling. As input time steps need not be consecutive, the number of distinct samples increases from linearly to combinatorially many. By breaking the temporal order, this technique also helps transformers to capture dependencies among time steps in finer granularity. We achieve competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art on real-world datasets.

### [Modeling a Heterogeneous World]

**Abstract**: This chapter takes as its starting point the idea that any model of the economy must have heterogeneous agents. Such agents together form a complex adaptive system where the aggregate behavior emerges from the interaction between the individuals. Such systems do not lend themselves to being modeled analytically. We use three examples to illustrate how one is obliged to use agent based models to capture the dynamics of such systems. For our first example, the Marseille fish market, we show how to move beyond the most simplistic theoretical model we have to move to a computational approach. We then look at the effect of a potential shock to a financial market, and finally at the heterogeneity of the financial system. The last two expose the futility of trying to develop a complete analytical model. We argue for specific models for specific cases. This is a more engineering approach but perhaps a more realistic one.
